# CNN-Metal-Defect-Detector

Introduction

This project is centered around building a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the purpose of classifying metal defects on large-scale metal surface samples using the GC10-DET dataset \citep{GC10-DETDataset}. As seen in Figure 1, this dataset includes grey-scale images of 10 different metal defects including: creases, crescent gaps, inclusions, oil spots, punching holes, rolled pits, silk spots, waist foldings, water spots and welding lines. The choice of gray-scale data is important as it reduces the complexity of the neural network without compromising the quality of defect identification. The input images also have labels according to their defect type.
